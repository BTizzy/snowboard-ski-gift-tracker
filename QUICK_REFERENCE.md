## Common False Positives (Watch Out!)

| Problem | Sign | Solution |
|---------|------|----------|
| Out of stock | "Add to cart" button grayed out | Call retailer |
| Wrong size available | Page shows sizes but S is grayed | Try size chart link |
| Wrong price | Price drops from $595 to $495 (fake!) | Use incognito mode, screenshot |
| Fake free shipping | Shows free but charges $25 at checkout | Check cart before confirming |
| Color unavailable | "Polar White" page but "in stock" is different color | Verify exact product SKU |

---

## Backup Plan (If Can't Find Deal)

### Lower your expectations:
1. **Same color, different size?** → Check size S vs M availability
2. **Same size, different color?** → Consider Slate Blue or Acai
3. **Different jacket, same brand?** → Check Spyder Haven or Challenger
4. **Accept higher price?** → Set deadline for purchase (Jan 31)
5. **Check secondary market?** → Depop/Poshmark (used, 40-50% off)
