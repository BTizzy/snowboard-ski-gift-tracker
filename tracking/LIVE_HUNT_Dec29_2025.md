## ⚡ ACTION PLAN

### 1. The Spyder US "NEWYEARS" Code
I found a banner on Spyder.com: **"END OF YEAR SALE - SAVE UP TO 80% OFF Use Code: NEWYEARS"** [web:65].
- **Why do this first?** US-based means free shipping and free returns.
- **How:** Add to cart \u2192 Apply `NEWYEARS`.
- **Target:** If it works, you likely pay **$416-$476 USD**. This beats Deporvillage hassle.

### 2. The Deporvillage €350 Find
You found it! €350 is ~$380 USD.
- **Shipping:** Likely $30-40 USD to RI.
- **Duties:** **None** (Order <$800 USD is duty-free into US) [web:121].
- **Total:** ~$420 USD delivered.
- **Verdict:** Solid deal. If Spyder code fails, **BUY THIS.**

### 3. Peter Glenn (The Wildcard)
- **Number:** 1-800-818-0946
- **Why:** They might match Deporvillage price but with 2-day US shipping.

## 🔄 UPDATED INTEL

- **Deporvillage is LEGIT:** Reviews show it's real but shipping to US takes ~7-10 days [web:122].
- **No Duties to US:** Confirmed $800 de minimis threshold [web:121].
- **Spyder Code:** `NEWYEARS` is active *today*.

**Next Step:** Test that code. If it fails, grab the Deporvillage deal. You won.
