## 🔍 CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS (Dec 29, 2025)

### Status: POST-HOLIDAY CLEARANCE WINDOW ACTIVE ✅
- Peak deal period: Dec 26 - Jan 15 (TODAY IS DAY 4)
- Current window: 11 days remaining in this cycle
- Volatility: HIGH (women's size S inventory moves fast)

### Spyder Official Market Position
- **US MSRP:** $595 (no current discount)
- **Canada MSRP:** $827 CAD (~$620 USD) - higher due to currency
- **Free shipping threshold:** $150+ (single jacket qualifies)
- **Recent activity:** Spyder showing "NEW DROPS INCOMING" with "20% OFF" banner on Winter 2025 collection (test for future items)
- **Color availability:** Polar White, Acai, Slate Blue all listed as in-stock

### Key Discovery: US vs EU Pricing
🚨 **INSIGHT:** European retailers are selling Titania at €420.65 (sportfits.eu, -16% discount = ~$460 USD) but:
- Requires international shipping ($30-50 typical)
- Returns more complex (EU consumer protection applies differently)
- Still possible if US sources don't drop below $450

## 💡 INSIGHTS FROM THIS HUNT

1. **Polar White is premium pricing** - No current discounts on this specific color/size combination at US retailers
2. **EU route is viable** - Sportfits.eu already at €420.65 (-16%), but shipping/complexity concerns
3. **Post-holiday window is early** - We're only 4 days into the best deal period; expect 20%+ discounts by next week
4. **Peter Glenn is your wildcard** - They typically beat Spyder official significantly; they're the #1 priority to call
5. **Size S volatility is real** - Small women's sizes sell out fast; daily monitoring is justified
