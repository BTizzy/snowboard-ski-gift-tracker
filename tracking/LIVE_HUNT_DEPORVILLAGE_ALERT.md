## ⚠️ DEPORVILLAGE CONSIDERATIONS

### Pros
- ✅ EU-based = potentially cheaper EUR pricing
- ✅ Large sports retailer (legitimate, not sketchy)
- ✅ If €350 real = beats all US options
- ✅ Free returns policy (30 days mentioned in search results)

### Cons
- ❌ International shipping (US/Canada may have fees/delays)
- ❌ Cross-border customs potential
- ❌ Returns process more complex from North America
- ❌ Potential VAT/duties on import
- ❌ Slower delivery (EU to RI/Canada)

---

## 🎯 DECISION MATRIX (IF €350 CONFIRMED)

### IF total delivered to RI < $500 CAD
```
🔥 BUY FROM DEPORVILLAGE (saves $400+ vs Canada)
Even with shipping/duties, likely cheapest option
```

### IF total delivered to RI is $500-600 CAD
```
⚖️ COMPARE TO PETER GLENN
Call PG first (might be $570 with free US shipping)
If PG has it ≤$420 USD → BUY PG (domestic = easier returns)
If not → BUY DEPORVILLAGE (might still be cheaper)
```

### IF total delivered to RI > $600 CAD
```
💔 NOT WORTH IT
Wait for Spyder 20% off ($650 CAD) from US
Or call Peter Glenn for better pricing
```

## 🌍 INTERNATIONAL PURCHASE REALITY CHECK

**Why EU sites sometimes cheaper:**
- VAT in EU (included in price) vs different tax systems
- Different market pricing strategies
- End-of-season clearance in Europe may be more aggressive
- Currency benefits

**Why to still be cautious:**
- International shipping = $30-50+ typically
- Customs/duties = 10-20% possible
- Returns complicated (need to ship back to EU)
- Slower delivery (7-14 days typical)

---

## 📊 THE REAL MATH (EXAMPLE)

**Deporvillage scenario:**
```
Product:        €350 = $302 USD
Shipping (est): €25-40 = $27-43 USD  
Tax/Duties:     ~10% = $30 USD (rough)
Total:          ~$360-375 USD = $490-510 CAD

Vs Peter Glenn:
$417 USD = $570 CAD (but free shipping, US-based)

Deporvillage wins by ~$70 CAD IF shipping/duties low
But returns are harder
```

---

## 🎯 FINAL DECISION POINT

**IF €350 is real and total delivered ≤ $500 CAD:**
→ **DEPORVILLAGE IS YOUR WINNER**

**IF €350 not real OR delivered > $550 CAD:**
→ **CALL PETER GLENN INSTEAD**

**IF both options miss:**
→ **WAIT FOR SPYDER EMAIL (20% off = $476 USD)**
