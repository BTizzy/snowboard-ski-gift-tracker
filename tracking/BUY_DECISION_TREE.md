## THE FASTEST PATH TO DECISION

### STEP 1: CALL PETER GLENN RIGHT NOW

```
📞 Phone: [NEED TO FIND - CHECK WEBSITE FOOTER]
Ask: "Do you have the Spyder Titania Hooded Jacket in Polar White, 
Women's Size Small in stock? What's the current price?"
```

**IF YES (Stock exists):**
→ **Expected price: $415-420 USD**  
→ **DECISION: BUY IMMEDIATELY** (within your $420 target)  
→ **Cost in CAD: ~$565-575** (vs $926 Canada direct)  
→ **Savings: ~$350-360 CAD**

**IF NO (Out of stock):**
→ Go to STEP 2

---

### STEP 2: WAIT FOR SPYDER EMAIL

```
Spyder is showing "20% OFF NEW DROPS" banner
Expected arrival: This week (Dec 30-31)
```

**When email arrives with code:**

1. **Test in Incognito Mode**
   ```
   Open: https://www.spyder.com/products/womens-titania-jacket-white
   Try code on: Titania Polar White
   Expected total: ~$476 USD
   ```

2. **If code works:**
   - **DECISION: BUY** (meets your $420+ target)
   - Cost in CAD: ~$650 CAD
   - Better than Canada direct: YES (√ saves ~$276)

3. **If code doesn't apply to Titania:**
   - Go to STEP 3

---

### STEP 3: CHECK SECONDARY US RETAILERS

```
Check in this order:
1. REI: https://www.rei.com/search?q=spyder+titania
2. Dick's Sporting Goods: https://www.dickssportinggoods.com
3. SlickDeals: https://www.slickdeals.net (search "Spyder")
```

**If any show Titania Polar White S:**
- Compare final price (item + shipping + tax)
- If total ≤ $450 USD ($615 CAD): BUY
- If total > $500 USD ($683 CAD): Proceed to STEP 4

---

### STEP 4: FALLBACK OPTIONS (WAIT UNTIL JAN 5)

```
We're only 4 days into post-holiday clearance.
Peak discounts usually hit 7-14 days in.
```

**Option A: Buy at Spyder US Direct ($595 + tax = $650 CAD)**
- Pros: Official source, 60-day returns, guarantee authentic
- Cons: No discount yet, highest current price
- Timeline: Can wait until Jan 15 for sale

**Option B: Secondary Market**
- Depop/Poshmark: Gently used, 40-50% off
- Cost: $300-400 CAD
- Cons: No returns, longer shipping, authenticity risk

**Option C: Alternative Color**
- Same jacket, different color (Slate Blue, Acai)
- Maybe one color gets discount faster
- Check Spyder daily through Jan 5

## 🚨 FINAL REMINDER

**You were RIGHT to ask about Canada.** But here's why you buy from US:

```
Canada Direct at MSRP:  $926 CAD after tax
US with 20% promo:     $650 CAD equivalent
Peter Glenn typical:   $565 CAD equivalent  ⭐ BEST

Canada pricing already adjusted for currency + market markup.
You get better deals hunting US retailers with discounts.
```

**The move: Find Peter Glenn's number and call them NOW.**

That's it. Everything else flows from that one call.
